## Description

The E-SFI-MVLEM-3D model (Figure 1a) is a three-dimensional four-node element with 24 DOFs that incorporates axial-flexural-shear interaction and can be used for nonlinear analysis of non-rectangular reinforced concrete walls subjected to multidirectional loading. The E-SFI-MVLEM-3D model is derived by combining two previously available models, a two-dimensional ([E-SFI](https://github.com/carloslopezolea/E-SFI_Documentation)) model, and a three-dimensional ([SFI-MVLEM-3D](https://kkolozvari.github.io/SFI-MVLEM-3D/)) model. The major enhancement in the model formulation compared to its parent SFI-MVLEM-3D comes from implementing a closed-form solution for calculating horizontal axial strains at fibers of the wall element. This significantly reduced the number of element degrees of freedom, which resulted in analysis run-time that is reduced to approximately 25% and a convergence rate that is increased roughly two times (Figure 2).

## Example

Specimen TUC (Constantin 2016) is analyzed using the SFI-MVLEM-3D. Figure 2a shows the photo of the test specimen and the multidirectional displacement pattern applied at the top of the wall, while Figure 2b-c show the SFI-MVLEM-3D model of specimen TUC.

**Figure 2: SFI-MVLEM-3D Model of specimen TUC**

Figure 3 compares measured and simulated load-deformation responses for specimen TUC in E-W (Figure 3a) and N-S (Figure 3b) directions, as well as for diagonal cycles between positions E-F (Figure 3c) and G-H (Figure 3d). As results comparisons illustrate, the SFI-MVLEM-3D predicts well the overall strength and stiffness of the wall for loading cycles in E-W (Figure 3a) and N-S (Figure 3b) directions where the behavior of the specimen was primarily in the linear elastic range since the maximum magnitude of displacements applied at the top of the wall corresponded to a drift level of only 1.0%. For diagonal cycles (Figure 3c and Figure 3d), the model slightly overestimates the initial stiffness of the specimens, but accurately captures the overall SRSS lateral load resisted by the specimen, with the only exception that the lateral load is overestimated during the last loading cycles corresponding to the largest drift of 2.5%. The cyclic stiffness and pinching characteristics of the wall are well-predicted by the model.

Figure 5 shows crack propagation predicted by the SFI-MVLEM-3D model for specimen TUC during the initial cycles of the test. It can be obsered from the figure that crack orientations and distributions are reasonable given the different loading directions imposed on the model.

Side-by-side comparison of the analytically-obtained vertical strains (Figure 5a-c.1) and shear stresses along wall base (Figure 5a-c.2) demonstrates the capability of the model to capture the interaction between the axial tensile/compressive strains (and resulting stresses) and the in-plane shear stresses developing in the panel-fibers of the SFI-MVLEM-3D elements. Results presented in Figure 5 clearly illustrate that for each of the loading positions, the majority of the shear force demand imposed at the wall is resisted by the regions (panel-fibers) that are subjected to axial compression, while little-to-no shear stress occurs in the panel-fibers subjected to tension. Commonly used fiber-based models that treat axial/flexural and shear behaviors as uncoupled (e.g., displacement based element in OpenSees, shear wall element in Perform 3D) cannot capture this highly non-uniform distribution of shear demands across the wall cross-section and may be subject to considerable bias in predicting shear demands developing in the piers (flanges, web) of non-planar walls subjected to multi-directional seismic actions.
